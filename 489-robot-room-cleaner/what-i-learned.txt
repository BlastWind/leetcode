1. When chosing attempting to cycle through an array, use %
In this question, we cycle through the directions, this is nicely 
done by setting up a direction array whose consecutive elements are 
one turns away from each other: 
directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
and then do 
for i in range(4): 
	direction = directions[(i + prevDirection) % 4]

2. Backtracking can happen in children or parent
I could either do 

recurse(...): 
	logic 
	recurse(...) # issue child backtrack call 
	backtrack() # backtrack after recurse() completes: The parent call resetsthe side effects of the child call
	logic 

or: 

recurse(...): 

	logic 
	recurse(...) # issue child backtrack call 
	logic 

	backtrack() # backtrack at the very end: The child call returns to previous state by itself
